# Calculator Project

This is a calculator project developed using Vite and TypeScript, aimed at practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The project serves as a practical example of building a web application from scratch, employing vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript for a strong foundation in object-oriented development.

## Learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This project is designed for developers looking to enhance their understanding of OOP in TypeScript. Key OOP principles, such as encapsulation and abstraction, are implemented within the Calculator class.

- Calculator class encapsulates the calculator's state and functionality.
- Methods within the class are defined for clearing, appending numbers, and computing results.
- The class demonstrates the power of TypeScript in creating well-structured, maintainable code.
